# Past Projects done while at Lakeside High School (2015 - 2017)


## CritterManager
	Most of the classes and utilities are instructor provided code to help create
	a framework to test different "critter" objects that roam around a fake world and 
	eat food and "attack" other critters. There is a given hierarchy of different critters within
	the world that beat others and remove them from the world. 
	List of written files: 
		Ant.class Ant.java
		Bird.class Bird.java
		Hippo.class Hippo.java
		Lion.class Lion.java
		MiniMain.java -- (test file)
		Stone.class Stone.java
		Vulture.class Vulture.java


## Poker
	The Poker project simulates a fake game where cards are dealt to players and tests are run 
	to make sure there isn't an invalid deck or card in play. This serves as a good framework for
	future projects dealing (no pun intended) with the Deck, Card, or Poker classes. 

## Snakefun
	Using GridWorld as our GUI (instructor provided), we create a classic Snake parallel game with flowers acting as our food. Moving the snake around the GridWorld is handled by the arrow keys, and the goal of the game is to eat as many flowers as possible. 

## StudentManager
	Student Manager is a tool that helps store data about a Student given name, grade, and number of classes. There is also a tester created to make sure the Student class works as expected. The client can add students, add courses, and retreive data of any student. 

## TeamManager 
	Same as the Student Manager, TeamManager is a tool that stores data about certain Teams,  Players within those teams, as well as current win-loss record of those teams. The client can create new teams, new players, set wins, losses and ties, and simulate games given won() and lost() functions. 

## TileManager 
	TileManager is a program that creates a GUI, and lets the user add random tiles by clicking on the screen, and deleting and adding more based on clicks and keyboard input. TileManager has instructor given code setting up the framework for our tiles, but it was our job to integrate the Tiles themselves (CircleTile, RectangleTile, TileManager).

## Melody 
	Melody was one of my favorite projects, involving a Melody text file reader that loaded, played, modified, as well as reversed the songs passed in as text files. The melody uses a Queue to store notes from the text file and apply functions on the notes. Melody.java holds the student-created code to work alongside the Instructor provided code. The song txt files were created by the student to use as test files for the program.
